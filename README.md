I am a computational scientist with expertise in molecular modeling, soft matter physics and high-performance computing.

In a nutshell, I am interested in explaining intriguing phenomena at atomic, molecular and nanometer scales in the area of soft materials design. To investigate these phenomena efficiently, I develop software tools and sampling methods to improve molecular simulation both in calculation speed and statistical quality.
